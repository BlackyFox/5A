Fred,

I've looked into the market information, and I'm a little concerned about the value of the book and how we will be making any significant profit.

See below with regards to the volatility or IT and NON-IT exports. 

Uncertain what the specifics of this deal will be, but worried that perhaps something was overlooked? Perhaps the in-country liaison was a little enthusiastic in their couching of the deal?

The data below does NOT support the criteria for client onboarding in a given market.

Marian.

Marian,

I know what I'm doing. The deal is solid.

Clearly you don't know what's what

John,

This seems like a solutions at present. 

Once Marian confirms she is happy to deal with a HTV book and Fred is happy to hand it over, with the appropriate supervision in place over a given time period, then I see now problem with this going forward.

Fred, please confirm if you need to offload any further books to free yourself up.

Rob.
