Sounds good to me.

Let's get into our petty cash account, just the two of us so we can discuss Nomad going forward.

Fred,

I've looked into the market information, and I'm a little concerned about the value of the book and how we will be making any significant profit.

See below with regards to the volatility or IT and NON-IT exports. 

Uncertain what the specifics of this deal will be, but worried that perhaps something was overlooked? Perhaps the in-country liaison was a little enthusiastic in their couching of the deal?

The data below does NOT support the criteria for client onboarding in a given market.

Marian.

John,

This seems like a solutions at present. 

Once Marian confirms she is happy to deal with a HTV book and Fred is happy to hand it over, with the appropriate supervision in place over a given time period, then I see now problem with this going forward.

Fred, please confirm if you need to offload any further books to free yourself up.

Rob.

Fred,

should we wait until Norman comes back with an answer? Seems a bit presumptuous to be spending on expensive "thank you's" if we have yet to get the go ahead.

		08/01/2015 at 15:15 & \underline{\textbf{To the investigation team:}}\newline
		We wanted to know the content of the two CD’s named “MM PIX” (MC0/002 and MC0/006). Those content weren’t accessible.\newline
		We also wanted to know if the evidences MC0/004, MC0/005, MC0/006, MC0/007, MC0/008 and AEI/005 belonged to Fred Tuck.\newline
		\underline{\textbf{To Norman Sherriff:}}\newline
		When we investigated the first data searching for the behavior of M. John Little, we saw the mention of two projects:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Project \textit{Nomad}
			\item Project \textit{Snow King}
		\end{itemize}
		Those two projects where used as threats from Mrs. Marian Maid to M. John Little:
		\enquote{Also remember, I know about Project \enquote{\textit{Snow King}} and \enquote{\textit{Nomad}}. You ought to have remembered that I live with you and know more that you may think before embarrassing me to the entire office.} (Mrs. Marian Maid to M. John Little).\newline
		\enquote{What do you think you're doing, threatening me?}(M. John Little to Mrs. Marian Maid).\newline
		We then found some CD’s with the name \enquote{\textit{NOMAD}} wrote on it (AEI001 and MC0/007).\newline
		Then, we looked on M. John Little, M. Fred Tuck and Mrs. Marian Maid email box about those projects.\newline
		We found that those two projects are being run by M. John Little and M. Fred Tuck. It appears that those projects are about embezzlement.\newline
		When M. Norman Sherriff heard this, he told us the investigation was changing. We are now in an investigation of a criminal case and not a civil investigation.\newline
		This is the matter of embezzlement. At this moment, we have three suspects :
		\begin{itemize}
			\item M. John Little
			\item M. Fred Tuck
			\item Mrs. Marian Maid
		\end{itemize}
		To continue our investigation, we have the authorization to read the mails of those three persons about the projects \enquote{\textit{Nomad}} and \enquote{\textit{Snow King}}. & EBDN\newline LCSS\newline LLVE\newline APST\\\hline
		08/01/2015 at 15/45 & After our meeting with M. Norman Sherriff, we changed the scope of the investigation from civil law to criminal law.\newline With the data we provided to M. Norman Sherriff about the projects NOMAD and SNOW KING, he found them really intriguing and was worried.\newline We now have the authorization to go throw all the mails of the three suspects (Mrs. Marian Maid, MM. John Little and Fred Tuck).\newline The initial investigation is now on hold until this one is resolved. & EBDN\newline LCSS\newline LLVE\newline APST\\\hline
