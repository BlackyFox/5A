\subsection{Suspicious activities regarding "Project Nomad" and "Project Snow King"}
We changed the investigation orientation when we digged deeper about what Mrs. Marian Maid said in the email provided to us. She has clearly threaten M. John Little with two project's names: "Project Snow King" and "Project Nomad". As explained before, it was this threat which caused Mrs. Jenny King to call us in order to investigate the subject told in the previous section.\\
While processing and analyzing emails from M. John Little, M. Fred Tuck and Mrs. Marian Maid, it has been discovered that the two projects were linked. As it can be found in a mail from M. Fred Tuck and M. John Little:\\

The subject "Project Snow King" and the mention of "Nomad" in the same mail prove that these two projects are working together. Nomad is most likely a subsection of Project Snow King. Moreover, it has been found suspicious that two nicknames "Desert Walker" and "Bedouin" were mentioned. At this time, we can not explicitly found the identities of these two supports because of the lack of informations regarding them. Adding this, M. Fred Tuck wrote that he has communicate the password of some books, number of them can not be told, but he did not use the standard mail of his company to do so. Instead he "PMed" them to M. John Little by any over communication system.\\
This email was the starting point of the orientation's change of our investigation. With these informations, the team went to M. Norman Sherriff and presented the proof to him on the 10th of October 2015. As the subject of these mails is most likely speaking about embezzlement, our affectation changed. We stopped the work on M. John Little behavior and started a new one under the criminal law on what can be found about these two projects, who were the actors and what were their subjects.

\subsubsection{Project Nomad}
Project Nomad was the first to be analyzed. This decision was made according to the mails dates found concerned on the name of the project. To do so, we filtered all mails which contained the word "Nomad" in their subject or content. Two mails poped up from the other, both including M. John Little and M. Fred Tuck; email 1 \ref{MailNomad1} email 2 \ref{MailNomad2}. Both of this emails were send after the two emails provided to us by Mrs. Jenny King (which included the behavior problem between Mrs. Marian Maid and M. John Little).\\
In email 1 \ref{MailNomad1}, it is clear that M. John Little and M. Fred Tuck are involved in the "Nomad" project and know the subject really well. They don't mention another person in it so it is most likely that they are the two protagonist of "Nomad".\\
In email 2 \ref{MailNomad2}, the subject of the email is "Nomad" and the project is short on time as they need to prepare what its next step is.

\subsubsection{Project Snow King}
Project Snow King emails were found with the acronym "SK", which probably mean "Snow King". In all the emails found, Mrs. Marian Maid, M. Fred Tuck and M. John Little were involved in the discussions. We already shown one of the mail in the first section. It seems that Mrs. Marian Maid doesn't know as much as the two others persons about this project.\\
In the first email \ref{SnowKing1}, it seems that Mrs. Marian Maid is aware of a problem concerning cash book in the bank and inform M. Fred Tuck about it. The answer of M. Fred Tuck seems most likely to not argue about his point of view and his decisions.\\
In the second email \ref{SnowKing2}, which is a forward of the first mail by M. Fred Tuck to M. John Little. M. Fred Tuck's ton seems to change in this mail though. He seems to be worried about what Mrs. Marian Maid said and inform M. John Little about the situation, asking for his point of view. We can not investigate further because we do not have M. John Little answer to this email.\\
In the last email \ref{SnowKing3}, another character seems to be concerned about the project: M. Robert Hood. It seems that M. John Little is asking him to give Mrs. Marian Maid a certain book on a specific contract with "Bentons International". Mr. Robert Hood is approving John's proposal.\\
The last mail \ref{Bentons} which subject is about Bentons International is more interesting. It's an exchange between M. Fred Tuck and M. John Little. The two persons seems to manipulate M. Robert Hood to accept John's proposal in a specific goal which is not clear. They seem to be happy about Robert's decision as their plan was going as they planned.
