\subsection{Disciplinary matter involving John Little and Marian Maid}
\subsubsection{First emails}
At the beginning of the investigation, we had been handed two emails conversation between Mrs. Marian Maid and M. John Little. In those conversations, we can denote some important information:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Mrs. Marian Maid wants to talk to M. John Little about a picture he has potentially showed to M. Fred Tuck.\\ M. John Little doesn't deny on this and add there \enquote{there's way more exciting stuff on the drive}.
 \item We then learn that M. John Little may have a drive with some compromising pictures of Mrs. Marian Maid. Since the company's HR policy allow to bring some personal devices at work, he might have took it to his workplace.
 \item Mrs. Marian Maid tells M. John Little that this kind of personal matters don't belong in such a working place.
 \item Mrs. Marian Maid then threatens M. John Little when saying \enquote{I know about Project "Snow King" and "Nomad". You ought to have remembered that I live with you and know more that you may think before embarrassing me to the entire office}.\\
 With this threat, we learn something valuable about those projects. Why would she use them as leverage against M. John Little if they didn't had something suspicious?
 \item Finally, M. John Little threatens back Mrs. Marian Maid. He also insults her in the email.
\end{itemize}
With all those information, we were able to ask M. Norman Sherriff the authorization to perform a search and seizure at M. John Little and M. Fred Tuck.\\
We also had the permission to access the email database for Mrs. Marian Maid, M. John Little and M. Fred Tuck.

\subsubsection{Search and seizure}
\paragraph{M. John Little's desk}~\\\par
During the search and seizure of M. John Little's desk, we found the following evidences:
\begin{description}
 \item[AEI 001 (loc B)] CD named \enquote{NOMAD} found under the desk of M. John Little (with a post-it \enquote{FP-05 14:45})
 \item[AEI 002 (loc E)] USB key taped behind M. John Little's screen
 \item[AEI 003 (loc G)] Desktop computer (Dell Optiplex GX620)
 \item[MCO/001 (loc J)] USB key hidden in a desktop vacuum cleaner (Henry Hoover)
 \item[AEI 004 (loc K)] Hard disk drive inside a Pelican case inside a drawer (with a post-it \enquote{SB02 7/3/15 13.54})
 \item[MCO/002 (loc L)] CD named \enquote{MM PIX} inside a drawer
 \item[MCO/003 (loc L)] Camera Canon inside a drawer. We don't know if it contains a memory card and if it is empty or not.
\end{description}
With a first look, we can already be concerned about the contains of evidences \textit{AEI 001} and \textit{MCO/003}. Those two evidences may be linked to the strange project (\textit{NOMAD}) and to the pictures of Mrs. Marian Maid (\enquote{\textit{MM PIX}}).
