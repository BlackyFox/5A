\subsection{Disciplinary matter involving John Little and Marian Maid}
\subsubsection{First emails}
At the beginning of the investigation, we had been handed two emails conversation between Mrs. Marian Maid and M. John Little. In those conversations, we can denote some important information:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Mrs. Marian Maid wants to talk to M. John Little about a picture he has potentially showed to M. Fred Tuck.\\ M. John Little doesn't deny on this and add there \enquote{there's way more exciting stuff on the drive}.
 \item We then learn that M. John Little may have a drive with some compromising pictures of Mrs. Marian Maid. Since the company's HR policy allow to bring some personal devices at work, he might have took it to his workplace.
 \item Mrs. Marian Maid tells M. John Little that this kind of personal matters don't belong in such a working place.
 \item Mrs. Marian Maid then threatens M. John Little when saying \enquote{I know about Project "Snow King" and "Nomad". You ought to have remembered that I live with you and know more that you may think before embarrassing me to the entire office}.\\
 With this threat, we learn something valuable about those projects. Why would she use them as leverage against M. John Little if they didn't had something suspicious?
 \item Finally, M. John Little threatens back Mrs. Marian Maid. He also insults her in the email.
\end{itemize}
With all those information, we were able to ask M. Norman Sherriff the authorization to perform a search and seizure at M. John Little and M. Fred Tuck.\\
We also had the permission to access the email database for Mrs. Marian Maid, M. John Little and M. Fred Tuck.

\subsubsection{Search and seizure}
\paragraph{M. John Little's desk}~\\\par
During the search and seizure of M. John Little's desk, we found the following evidences:
\begin{description}
 \item[AEI 001 (loc B)] CD named \enquote{NOMAD} found under the desk of M. John Little (with a post-it \enquote{FP-05 14:45})
 \item[AEI 002 (loc E)] USB key taped behind M. John Little's screen
 \item[AEI 003 (loc G)] Desktop computer (Dell Optiplex GX620)
 \item[MCO/001 (loc J)] USB key hidden in a desktop vacuum cleaner (Henry Hoover)
 \item[AEI 004 (loc K)] Hard disk drive inside a Pelican case inside a drawer (with a post-it \enquote{SB02 7/3/15 13.54})
 \item[MCO/002 (loc L)] CD named \enquote{MM PIX} inside a drawer
 \item[MCO/003 (loc L)] Camera Canon inside a drawer. We don't know if it contains a memory card and if it is empty or not.
\end{description}
With a first look, we can already be concerned about the contains of evidences \textit{AEI 001} and \textit{MCO/003}. Those two evidences may be linked to the strange project (\textit{NOMAD}) and to the pictures of Mrs. Marian Maid (\enquote{\textit{MM PIX}}).

\paragraph{M. Fred Tuck's desk}
During the search and seizure of M. Fred Tuck's desk, we found the following evidences:
\begin{description}
 \item[MC0/004] Laptop Vostro 1540, USB key (MC0/005) plugged in, CD (MC0/006) inside. Shutdown, battery unplugged
 \item[MC0/005] USB key plugged to the laptop
 \item[MC0/006] CD named \enquote{MM PIX} inside the laptop
 \item[MC0/007] CD named \enquote{NOMAD} taped under M. Fred Tuck desk
 \item[MC0/008] Hard disk drive case (SATA to USB) empty
 \item[AEI 005] USB key taped under M. Fred Tuck
\end{description}
With all those evidences, we can correlate with the ones from M. John Little. They both have two CD's named \enquote{NOMAD} and \enquote{MM PIX}. Depending on the content of those CD's, it could prove that M. John Little has been sharing some pictures to M. Fred Tuck.\\
Also, the fact that all those devices were hidden (under a desk, inside a vacuum cleaner, etc\ldots) is suspicious about their contents.

\subsection{Embezzling matter involving M. John Little, M. Fred Tuck and Mrs. Marian Maid}


\subsubsection{All emails}

\subsection{Discoveries}

\subsection{Recommendations}
From the evidences and the discovery we made on previous sections, we can provide the following recommendations:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Conduct some interviews of the three protagonists (M. John Little, M. Fred Tuck and Mrs. Marian Maid) about the projects NOMAD and SNOW KING
 \item Conduct an throughout investigation on all the company's accounts to verify if there is some embezzlement or money laundering
 \item Contact the authorities to let them realize a full investigation with the power vested in them. We can already give them all the evidences proving all the suspicions this investigation found
\end{itemize}
